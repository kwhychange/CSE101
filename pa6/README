---how to run the program---

go into directory with the files above
type "make" or "make ListTest" or "make BigIntegerTest" to make respective programs
type ./Arithmetic "input file" "output file" (for Arithmetic)
type ./ListTest (for ListTest)
type ./BigIntegerTest (for BigIntegerTest)
make clean to remove program and .o files
