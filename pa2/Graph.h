//Function addEdge() inserts a new edge joining u to v, i.e. u is added to the adjacency 
//List of v, and v to the adjacency List of u.
//Your program is required to maintain these lists in sorted order by increasing labels.

//Function addArc() inserts a new directed edge from u to v, i.e. v is added

//Function BFS() runs the BFS algorithm on the Graph G with source s,
//setting the color, distance, parent, and source fields of G accordingly.

//Finally, function printGraph() prints the adjacency list representation of G to the 
//file pointed to by out. The format of this representation should match the above 
//examples, so all that is required by the client is a single call to printGraph().
